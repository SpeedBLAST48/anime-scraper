animeland-video-scrapper
========================

This is a simple webscrapper that extracts the MP4 download URLs from ww2.animeland.tv. I made it because of my love for anime and put it
on GitHub to share with my IRL friends who are crazy about anime like me.

It doesn't work for all the series on animeland.tv and the ```rename.py``` script wont rename episodes in the right order if the episodes
on the website are skipped.

This doesn't download the episodes, it only creates a new text file with the download URLs. I use IDM to batch download after and run 
```rename.py``` after the downloads are complete. Works perfectly good for me so far.
